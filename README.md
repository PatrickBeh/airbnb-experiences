<h1>React & Tailwind CSS Slider Project</h1>
This project helped me get better at React and practice Tailwind CSS. I used the Swiper library to create a slider with a Slider component that shows multiple Card components. The card data comes from an array, making adding and updating cards easy. It was a great way to learn how to build dynamic and responsive components.
